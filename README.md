# FdF
Simple 3d visualizer by coordinates.
The program reads the vertices of coordinates from the file and their color, if it has, checks it for errors and then draws a depth map. The map can be moved and also rotated 45 degrees. Card format.fdf.
Tested and work only on Mac OS because of minilibx library.
